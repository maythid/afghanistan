                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">The United States started providing aid to Afghanistan in September of 2001 through Operation Enduring Freedom. The initial phases of the operation were military based, but later became more focused on civil service and government intervention, nonetheless military assistance was still provided. The goal of the aid was to help turn Afghanistan into a stable nation that was grounded in democracy. Stability was supposed to curtail the breading of terrorism within the country, by providing each ethnic group with a voice in the government to stop their clashing that lead to violence. The United States intervened in the governmental, security, economic, educational, health, agriculture, and gender sectors.&nbsp;<div><br></div></h3>

The U.S. gov helped to support this democracy by registering 10 million afghans to vote. That is close to half of the 24.12 million citizens in 2004. This was all done by October 2004. Considering that a part large part of the population was too young to vote, they registered more than half of the eligible voting population.<br><br>The United States contributed the Afghan government by creating their new laws and constitution by sending in constitutional and legal experts They believed that a new set of laws and a democratic constitution would help bring order to Afghanistan, and that this order would help unite the the people of Afghanistan.

The united States wanted to improve the Afghan National Army as well as the Afghan National police, by both growing the organization in size and train officers to be better prepared to handle prevalent issues.  The United States has trained over 25,000 officers and plans to train more in the five training centers they bultu across the country. The importance of the security sector in Afghanistan is to help crack down on the militia and terrorist groups and to remove the provincial warlords. The united states has been helping to  provincial reconstruction teams in order to so. As of late, over 15,000 militia members have been demobilized sue the United States efforts.&nbsp;<br></p>

They helped to create jobs and provided small to medium loans to kickstart entrepreneurship within Afghanistan. Selling and buying is how you create a strong economy so the the United States also rebuilt roads to ensure and market to ensure that the citizens could easily buy and transport their good. Another vital part of having a strong economy is to have a central bank so that the money can always be regulated and the economy can be stable. The United States used their knowledge of what a successful free market economy looks like to help spur economic development in Afghanistan.&nbsp;</p>

They contracted and remodeled 338  health clinic, 13 of which are hospitals,and 310 of which the U.S. is actually helping to serve. The united states also helped to train 5,000 health work, 337 midwives, over 700 nurses and doctors. This training has helped doctors to how treat their patients more effectively in order to provide better results. It was estimated that over 7.1 million Afghan lives will be improved due to the health reforms made by the United States.</p>

The first step the United States took was to stop the illegal drug trade the involved the growing and selling of poppies, in order to legitimize the Afghan economy. It then focused on fixing the infrastructure like irrigation so that farmers could rely on their crops as a source of income. With crops being produced the United States helped to expand the market for these crops inationall as well as internationally. When these initial program were successful the united States invested in commercial agro-processing and production industries, so they could sell the finished product. Raw materials make less profit then finished good, giving Afghans the tools to so helped enhance their economy. Since these reforms began production of crops has more than doubled,and farmers incomes have increased.&nbsp;<br></p>

As the U.S. moved away from working on emergency situation they began to focus on long term stability, and that ts when they become more focused on gender roles for women. In afghanistan women, are not given the same freedoms or respect that many of us are given in the west . The United States worked to provide both healthcare assistant os as economic assistance to women. In afghanistan a woman dies every 27 minutes trying to give birth. This a staggering high number,s o the United States provided women with more healthcare access and literacy on pregnancy. To give women a chance in the economic sector after year of repression, the U.S. ensured that women would have more access to education that they did before. They also provide agricultural training to give them access to the biggest economic sector in Afghanistan. The United States is making an attempt to improve the quality of life for women in Afghanistan, but clearly has a long way to go.<br></p>

                                   Afghanistan schools had either been destroyed or damaged due to the fall of the taliban, and were yet to be rebuilt. Thousands of children were not in school, especially girls due to the oppression on women by the Taliban. United States worked to provide kids with tools and schools, in order to raise literacy and help train kids for the workforce. The United States rebuilt and reconstructed 315 schools within Afghanistan, and ensured each school had textbooks and other necessary school supplies. With the schools built, the U.S. helped enroll over 170,000 kids into schools, 58% of which were girls. They also constructed training facilities to help ensure the kids were taught by adequate teachers. Education is an important tool in constructing a democracy, and the United States understood that when they provide aid to Afghanistan. </p>
